      JUNG is a software library that provides a common and extendible language for the modeling, analysis, and visualization of data that can be represented as a graph or network. Its basis in Java allows JUNG-based applications to make use of the extensive built-in capabilities of the Java API, as well as those of other existing third-party Java libraries.
